# bot-discord

Bot for Discord developed with JavaScript (Node.js), for own studies! =D

To use this bot, understand how it works and see what you'll need to have installed, I recommend watching Rafaella Ballerini's video that teaches you how to make a bot exactly like this step by step. It was the video I watched to learn!
Here is the link to the video: https://youtu.be/zKOf1NGGStE

His functions are:

- /ping (responds with 'Pong!')
- /playlist-rock (returns a link to a rock playlist)
- /playlist-lofi (returns a link to a lofi playlist)
- /playlist-lofi-br (returns a link to a Brazilian lofi playlist)
- /docs (returns a button with some languages, when choosing the language it returns the link to the documentation of the chosen language)
- /git (returns Git commands)
